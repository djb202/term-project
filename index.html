      <p>
         Welcome to our beauty shop. Our staff of licensed aestheticians 
         has been providing personal and friendly service in the West Rogers 
         Park community on Chicago's Northside since 2010. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Together we have over 60 years of experience with the beauty techniques 
         of India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. We love sharing our knowledge 
         of the allure and good health accessible to people seeking new ways to 
         show their inner beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
         We're open on the weekends and later in the evening. We can accommodate single customers, 
         friends coming together, or parties up to 8.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         At our shop we believe good health comes from smart relaxation. Come to mark occasions 
         like a graduation, bat-mitvahs, weddings, and family events.
