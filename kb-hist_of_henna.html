         <h1>A history of henna</h1>
         <p>
         Henna is a vegetable dye derived from the plant <em>lawsonia inermis</em>.

         <p>
         It's been used for thousands of years by people from North Africa, 
         the Middle East and South Asia.
         </p>
         <p>
         There are two kinds of dye treatments that use the henna plant: red
            and black. They both derive from the same plant, except to make it
            black, coal tar is added. These darkening agents are unsafe and 
            we do not offer black henna.
         </p>
         <p>
         The henna plant is concentrated. Its red berries are pressed and 
         blended with the roots, white flowers, and exotic herns to form an 
         aromatic paste that gives a stain. The concetrated plant is packed 
         in a tube and we apply the paste on your skin in the pattern of 
         your choosing. There are several designs: floral, geometric, 
         paisley.
         </p>
         <p>
            Once the paste is applied, you must wait for it to dry. The longer 
            it remains in contact with your skin, the darker the color.
